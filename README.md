# McOsu

**Discord** (Feedback, Requests, Bug reports, etc.): https://discord.gg/3UQnt7X

An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay.

It is running on my own small cross-platform game engine written in C++, which still needs to be cleaned up before I can upload it here.
Binaries will be available for **Windows** and **Linux**, and maybe macOS in the future.
Note that Linux support is not as polished as Windows, and some functions such as native fullscreen mode do not work there yet.

##Notable features which osu! doesn't have (yet) in comparison:
- Mid-play empty section skipping
- Beatmap scrubbing (CTRL + ALT + Click drag)
- Override CS/AR/HP/OD
- Speed/BPM changer
- Change mods while playing
- Actually useful target practice mod
- Experimental mods (Wobble, First Person, Minimize, Playfield flipping, Jigsaw, etc.)
- The choice to use Score V2 in singleplayer
- Properly drawn playfield border
- Arbitrary HUD scale (Combo counter, accuracy, etc.)
- Enable/Disable approach circles, numbers, sliderendcircles, followpoints or any other element
- Ignore beatmap sample volume
- Enhanced hit error bar, shows misaims and extra clicks
- Nearly unlimited customizability using console commands for people who want to tinker with everything (e.g. osu_playfield_rotation, osu_circle_fade_out_time, osu_skip_time, etc.)

##Known incompatible GPUs:
- Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Chipset Family (can't create RenderTargets for drawing sliders)
- Intel G45/G43 Express Chipset
