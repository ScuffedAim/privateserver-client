An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay.

It is running on my own small cross-platform game engine written in C++, which still needs to be cleaned up before I can upload it here.
Binaries will be available for **Windows** and **Linux**, and maybe macOS in the future.
Note that Linux support is not as polished as Windows, and some functions such as native fullscreen mode do not work there yet.

Notable features which osu! doesn't have (yet) in comparison:
- Mid-play empty section skipping
- Beatmap scrubbing
- Override CS/AR/HP/OD
- Speed/BPM changer
- Change mods while playing
- Actually useful target practice mod
- Experimental mods (Wobble, First Person, Minimize, Playfield flipping, Jigsaw, etc.)
- The choice to use Score V2 in singleplayer
- Properly drawn playfield border
- Arbitrary HUD scale (Combo counter, accuracy, etc.)
- Enable/Disable approach circles, numbers, sliderendcircles, followpoints or any other element
- Ignore beatmap sample volume
- Enhanced hit error bar, shows misaims and extra clicks
- Nearly unlimited customizability using console commands for people who want to tinker with everything (e.g. osu_playfield_rotation, osu_circle_fade_out_time, osu_skip_time, etc.)
