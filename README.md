# McOsu

**This repository is currently only for people who are interested in looking at the code, there are no public releases yet (private alpha).**

Will be an unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay.

It is running on my own small cross-platform game engine written in C++, which still needs to be cleaned up before I can upload it here.
Binaries will be available for **Windows** and **Linux**, and maybe macOS in the future.
